Development of Emissions Api was started by a group of people who had known each other before and heard of an awesome funding called Prototypefund.
They fund projects of public interests tech in several passes each year.
Open source projects can applicate with their concept that fits the passes topic.

We heard of this satellite sentinel-5P, with its help, ESA makes numerous environmental measurements available to the public.
And there was this enforcement of regulations that prohibits the use of heavy oil on the high seas. But who would check if they do?
So we had this idea to use satellite based enviromental data to track down ships in the open sea that emmit too much emissions.
The idea was to detect unusually high emissions on the open sea and search for a ship in this specific location with the use of the automatic identification system (AIS).
But soon we found out that the refresh rate of satellite data is too slow and the data resolution is not high enough for this purpose.

Luckily we had another good idea for using the satellite data.
The measurement data of the satiellite is prepared in a fundamental way by ESA and provided via an api.
So the data is available to everyone but nothing easy to use for non-professionals who are just interested in enviromental data.
