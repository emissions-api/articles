Development of Emissions Api was started by a group of people who had known each other before and heard of an awesome funding called Prototypefund.
They fund projects of public interests tech in several passes each year and open source projects can applicate with their concept that fits the passes topic.
So we had this idea to use satellite based enviromental data to track down ships in the open sea that emmit too much emissions.
Because shortly before, there was this enforcement of regulations that prohibits the use of heavy oil on the high seas. But who would check if they do?
So we heard of this satellite sentinel-5P, with its help, ESA makes numerous environmental measurements available to the public.

The measurement data  of the satiellite is prepared in a fundamental way by ESA but nothing easy to use for non-professionals who are just interested in enviromental data.
